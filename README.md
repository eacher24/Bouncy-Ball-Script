# Bouncy-Ball-Script

## Aim of Assignment: 
- To be able to produce the integer number of bounces above a minimum height. 
- In which the initial height, minimum height and efficiency are receieved as inputs by the user. 
- A series of validation checks are performed in order to make sure no errors occur in the functions. 

Extra:
- A calculation in the case that the minimum height is zero i.e. no friction is included as an option at the end for the user to be able to investigate more variables that can be calculated.
